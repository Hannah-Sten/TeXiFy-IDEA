:experimental:

When using BibTeX autocompletion in TeXiFy version 0.6.8 or later, besides using the bibtex id you can also type parts of the author or title of the bibtex entry for it to appear in the suggestions list.
The suggestions list will show title and (to the right) the bibtex id.
If you press kbd:[Ctrl + Q] when having an item selected you can also view the authors.
When you select it, the bibtex id will be inserted.
