== Use of `\over` discouraged
== TeX styling primitives usage is discouraged

Instead of using styling commands like `{\bf bold text}` and `{\it italic text}`, use `\textbf{bold text}` and `\textit{italic text}`.
(In the second case, consider using `\emph{text}` for emphasis instead.)

== Discouraged use of `\def` and `\let`

== [[ins:avoid-eqnarray]]Avoid `eqnarray`
The `eqnarray` and `eqnarray==` environments are not recommended because they produce inconsistent spacing of the equal signs and make no attempt to prevent overprinting of the equation body and equation number.


== Discouraged use of primitive TeX display math
== Discouraged use of `\makeatletter` in tex sources
