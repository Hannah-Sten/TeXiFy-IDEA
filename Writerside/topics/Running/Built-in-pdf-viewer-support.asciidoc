:experimental:

_Since b0.7.4_

TeXiFy supports using the https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14494-pdf-viewer[PDF Viewer] plugin to view PDFs inside the IDE.
This includes forward and inverse search functionality.

To forward search, use menu:Tools[LaTeX > Forward search] or the shortcut listed there.
To inverse search, use kbd:[Ctrl + click].

To use the PDF Viewer plugin, install it via the plugin settings in your IDE.
In IntelliJ: menu:Settings[Plugins > search in marketplace], and select it in your LaTeX run configuration as the PDF viewer.
After compilation it will open the PDF viewer on the right.

At the moment of writing (April 2023), a newer version with bug fixes is available at https://github.com/slideclimb/intellij-pdf-viewer/releases
