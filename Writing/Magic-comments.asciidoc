== Root file

If TeXiFy does not guess your root file(s) correctly, you can help TeXiFy by using the `root` magic comment to point TeXiFy to a root file.
For example, use `%! root = main.tex` in a file that is included by `main.tex`, when TeXiFy cannot figure out that `main.tex` is a root file of this file.

== Switching parser off and on

If you want to temporarily switch off the parser for a part of your LaTeX, for example because there is a parse error which is causing other problems in your files, you can use the magic comments `%! parser = off` and `%! parser = on` to avoid parsing the text between these two comments.
The syntax `% !TeX parser = off` is also supported.

== Fake sections

Use `%! fake section` to introduce a fake section which can be folded like any other section.
Here, `section` can be one of `part`, `chapter`, `section`, `subsection`, `subsubsection`, `paragraph`, or `subparagraph`.
Fake sections can also have a title, so `%! fake subsection Introduction part 1` is valid.
