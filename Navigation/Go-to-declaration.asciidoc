By pressing kbd:[Ctrl + B] on a reference to a label, or a citation of a bibtex entry, your cursor will go to the declaration of the reference or citation.
In general, you can go back to your previous cursor location with kbd:[Ctrl + Alt + <-]

This also works with usages of commands defined with `\newcommand` definitions (in your fileset, not in LaTeX packages), but only if your command definition includes braces, like `\newcommand{\mycommand}{definition}`

Note that your cursor has to be placed somewhere in the parameter of the referencing command, not on the command itself.
For example in the case of `\re|f{mylabel}` where `|` denotes the cursor, then it will not work, but for `\ref{my|label}` it will.
