_Since b0.6.10_

In the link:Run-configurations#_choose_latex_distribution[Run configuration settings] you can choose to use TeX Live from WSL.

== Setup

* Install WSL, see for example https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
* Install TeX Live as usual, see for example link:Installation[TeX Live installation].
* Add `export PATH="/path/to/texlive/yyyy/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH"` to your `~/.bashrc`.

Currently, TeXiFy will use bash to run LaTeX compilers.
Test your installation with `bash -ic "pdflatex --version"`.

== Troubleshooting

If pdflatex is not found, double check if the default wsl distribution is the one in which you installed LaTeX with `wsl -l`
