_Since b0.7.3_

The Symbol tool window will by default anchor to the right tool window pane. Here you will find a wide range of symbols that you can insert by clicking on them. The required package will automatically be imported when clicking the symbol. The symbol gets inserted at the location of your caret in the editor. When you select a symbol like `(...)` or `Ã¢` the selected text will be surrounded properly.

The combobox allows you to limit the symbols to specific categories. You can use the search bar to search through the symbols in the selected category. You can search on generated latex/command, package name, short description and category name.

The symbol tool window supports both light and dark mode.
