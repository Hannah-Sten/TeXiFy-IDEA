Next to commands that include other files, there is a gutter icon.
You can click on it to bring you to the file, or you can use kbd[Ctrl + B] when your cursor is on the filename.
This includes commands like `\documentclass`, `\usepackage` and `\includegraphics` and many more.

== Import package

TeXiFy supports the `import` package with which you can include other LaTeX files.
Its main feature is the ability to set import path prefixes when you included a file.
For example, if you have `main.tex` which contains `\subimport{chapters/}{chapter-one.tex}`, and two files `chapters/chapter-one.tex` and `chapters/included.tex`, then in `chapter-one.tex` you can do `\input{included.tex` and it will resolve correctly.
Without the import package, you would need to write `\input{chapters/included.tex}` for the include to work.

The package also has the `\import` command for absolute instead of relative paths.
