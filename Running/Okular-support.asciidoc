_Since b0.6.8_

On Linux systems, TeXiFy supports Okular as a pdf viewer with forward and inverse search.

== Shortcuts
The default shortcut for forward search in IntelliJ is is kbd:[Ctrl + Alt + Shift + .].
The default shortcut for inverse search in Okular is kbd:[Shift + Left mouse click].

== Configuring inverse (or backwards) search
- In Okular, open the settings and go to the Editor tab.
- Select the Custom Text Editor in the editor field, and type the command `idea --line %l` (for PyCharm replace `idea` with `charm`).

It is possible that you have to enable the "Generate shell scripts" settings in Jetbrains Toolbox, see the https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/opening-files-from-command-line.html[IntelliJ documentation] for more info.
