    If you try to advise TeX on how to split the heading over a few lines using the '~' symbol so the '\\' command, then
    side effects may result when formatting the table of contents or generating the running head.
    In this case the simplest solution is to repeat the heading text without the specific markup in the optional
    parameter of the sectioning command.
