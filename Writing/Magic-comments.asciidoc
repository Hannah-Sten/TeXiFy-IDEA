== Switching parser off and on

If you want to temporarily switch off the parser for a part of your LaTeX, for example because there is a parse error which is causing other problems in your files, you can use the magic comments `%! parser = off` and `%! parser = on` to avoid parsing the text between these two comments.
The syntax `% !TeX parser = off` is also supported.
