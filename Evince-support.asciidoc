== Summary

The default shortcut for forward search in IntelliJ is kbd:[Ctrl + Alt + Shift + .].
The default shortcut for backward search in Evince is kbd:[Ctrl + Left mouse click].

== Explanation

==== Forward search
When your cursor is in IntelliJ and you have just compiled a document, you can look up which line in the pdf corresponds to the line your cursor is at by going in IntelliJ to the Tools - LaTeX menu in the top menu bar and clicking Evince - Forward Search, or using the shortcut kbd:[Ctrl + Alt + Shift + .].
This shortcut can also be used to bring the Evince window in view when you do not see it.

==== Backward or inverse search

You can also do the reverse: press kbd:[Ctrl] and click in Evince in a pdf you just compiled, and it should make your cursor go to the correct location in IntelliJ.
