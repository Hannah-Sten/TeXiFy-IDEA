In IntelliJ you can use the SDK settings editor to specify a custom LaTeX SDK, in order to let TeXiFy know where your LaTeX installation is.
This is of course only necessary if it is not in your PATH already, but in some cases (like with a Flatpak installation) it is not possible to modify your PATH.

You can find these settings in menu:File[Project Structure].
Under SDKs you can see all the configured SDKs.
If you click the plus button there, you can see the different types of SDKs you can add but it also shows automatically detected SDKs.

Once you have created an SDK (which is a global setting), you can select it as Project SDK under the Project menu.
Then you can in your run configuration under LaTeX Distribution select Use project SDK.
It is probably a good idea to do that for your link:Run-configurations[run configuration template] as well if you want to use it every time.

If you don't have `pdflatex` in your PATH, TeXiFy will show a warning that you won't be able to compile.
