== [[table-creation-wizard]]Table Creation Wizard

Displays a dialog with a table creation wizard with a table, caption, and label. Click the plus to add a column, the
minus to remove the column of the currently selected cell, and the pencil to edit this column.
Hit kbd:[tab] to edit the next cell (same row, column on the right of the current cell).
Hit kbd:[tab] on the last cell of a column to add a new row.

Each column has a name, and a type.
The available column types are:

- Text: This is normal text, aligned left.

LaTeX.
- Numbers: As per convention, numbers are aligned on the right.

If auxiliary files in a certain directory do not get deleted, make sure you mark that directory as a source directory by right-clicking on it and selecting menu:Mark Directory as[Sources Root].
