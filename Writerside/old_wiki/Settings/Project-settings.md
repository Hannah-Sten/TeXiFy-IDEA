## Option to change compiler for which to check compatibility
__Since b0.6.7__

In some cases, certain LaTeX can be valid when using one compiler but incorrect when using another.
For these cases, you can change the compiler to which your LaTeX is validated.
The inspections for which this is relevant have a quickfix that opens this settings page.

Also see the [available compilers](Compilers).
