Using live templates, you can quickly insert a predefined piece of text by typing just a few characters of a certain key.
You can denote places to which the cursor skips when you press kbd:[Tab] after inserting the live template.

To use a live template, type (a part of) the key, for example `fig`, hit enter when the live template is suggested in the autocomplete, type things and use kbd:[Tab] to skip to the next place to type information.

Currently implemented by default are live templates for:
- figures, tables, itemize, enumerate, and in math for summations and integrals;
- sectioning with automatic label (triggered with `\partl`, `\chapl`, `\secl`, etc.).

You can find these live templates, as well as add your own, under menu:File[Settings > Editor > Live Templates > LaTeX].
