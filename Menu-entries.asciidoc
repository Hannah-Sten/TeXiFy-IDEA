==== [[clear-aux-files]]Clear Auxiliary Files

menu:Tools[LaTeX > Clear Auxiliary Files]

Searches the entire project, i.e., every folder in the project module, for auxiliary files and deletes them. The files with the following extensions are defined as auxiliary files:

[source, subs="verbatim"]
aux, bbl, bcf, brf, fls, idx, ind, lot, lot, nav, out, snm, toc

If auxiliary files in a certain directory do not get deleted, make sure you mark that directory as a source directory by right-clicking on it and selecting menu:Mark Directory as[Sources Root].
