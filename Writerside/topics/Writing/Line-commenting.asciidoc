By default, the shortcut kbd:[Ctrl + /] will add a comment (`%`) character to the beginning of the line.
When multiple lines are selected, these will all be commented.

Note that the block comment shortcut kbd:[Ctrl + Shift + /] should not be used, as LaTeX does not have any block comments by itself.
