== The equation/TikZ preview is not working

Make sure you have installed the dependencies as described in link:Preview#Equation-preview[the Preview page].

If that doesn't help and you can run Kotlin programs, you can run the program below and report the output in your (new) issue.

== Error running 'main': Cannot run program "pdflatex"

Make sure you have followed all the installation instructions at https://github.com/Ruben-Sten/TeXiFy-IDEA#installation-instructions-installing-intellij-and-the-texify-idea-plugin

. Check if `pdflatex` is properly installed by running in a terminal or command prompt `pdflatex -v`. Probably this is not the case. If it is the case, then for some reason pdflatex cannot run. Test this with `pdflatex small2e` in a location where you have write access.
. Check if `pdflatex` is installed: if you have MikTeX start the MikTeX console and check that the `pdftex` package is installed. If you have TeX Live, check with `tlmgr install pdftex`.
. If so, make sure you have logged in and out to complete the installation of LaTeX, and especially with TeX Live make sure that TeX Live is added to your PATH.
. Make sure you did install MikTeX or TeX Live _for your user only_, so not for all users. If not, uninstall, install the right way and reboot.
. If you are on Windows or Mac and installing MikTeX, you can also try installing TeX Live instead.
. Ask on https://tex.stackexchange.com, providing as much details as possible (at least operating system, results of the tests of the first step, any attempts to solve it).


== What should my document structure look like?

In general you have a main file which contains the documentclass and the document environment (the `\begin{document}` and `\end{document}`).
From here you can include other files which can then include even more files and so on.
An example is:

[source,latex]
----
\documentclass{exam}

% Packages
\usepackage{amsthm}

\author{L.A.\ TeX}
\title{Example document setup}

% Possible other definitions, configurations etc. that you need
\theoremstyle{definition}
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}

% Document
\begin{document}

    \maketitle

    \section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
    \input{introduction}

    \section{Example theorems} \label{sec:exampleTheorem}
    \input{example-theorems}

\end{document}
----

where the files `introduction.tex` and `example-theorems.tex` contain just the content, for example these could be the complete file contents of `introduction.tex`:

[source,latex]
----
\begin{theorem}
    If the meanings of 'true' and 'false' were switched, then this sentence wouldn't be false.
\end{theorem}
----

== I have an error which complains about openout_any = p

When you get during compilation the error
----
makeindex: Not writing to /path/to/project/latexfile.ind (openout_any = p).
Can't create output index file /path/to/project/latexfile.ind.
----

or
----
bibtex: Not writing to ../out/latexfile.blg (openout_any = p).
----

this probably happens because you are trying to use makeindex or bibtex with a separate output directory. You should either disable the out directory in the run config or change the security setting in `texmf.cnf`, see https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/12686/how-do-i-run-bibtex-after-using-the-output-directory-flag-with-pdflatex-when-f/289336#289336[this tex.stackexchange.com answer].
This is a TeX Live security setting which you can change by editing `/path/to/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/web2c/texmf.cnf` and changing `openout_any = p` to `openout_any = a`.

== My index is not generated correctly

If you have TeXiFy version 0.6.7 or later, make sure that makeindex is run by TeXiFy, so you should see a run window called makeindex with the output.
See link:Makeindex[Makeindex].

=== Version 0.6.6 or older
Note that you _have_ to disable both the `auxil/` (in case of MiKTeX) and `out/` directories in the run configuration, otherwise the `.idx` file will not be found by the index package.

In general we would recommend using the `imakeidx` package like below, but equivalent index packages should also work.

Example:
[source,latex]
----
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{imakeidx}
\makeindex

\begin{document}
    \section{Introduction}
    Some \index{keywords} here
    for the \index{Index}.

    Another line with \index{words}.

    \printindex
\end{document}
----


== How can I set-up shortcuts for e.g. `\emph{}` or the itemize environment?

You can define a live template via menu:File[Settings > Editor > Live Templates]. For example, for the `itemize` environment, you could use the following template:

----
\begin{itemize}
    \item $PARM1$
\end{itemize}
----

Set the template to be applicable in LaTeX files.
Also see https://github.com/Hannah-Sten/TeXiFy-IDEA/wiki/Live-templates

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/Hannah-Sten/TeXiFy-IDEA/Writing/figures/marco.png[Screenshot of live template UI, showing the template text above along with an abbreviation of itemize and a description of 'Add itemize env'. The macro is set to be 'Applicable in LaTeX' and expands with the Tab key.]

Once the live template is created, close the Settings dialog. Use menu:Edit[Macros > Start Macro Recording] and enter the live template abbreviation. Finish recording the macro, and name it. Via menu:Settings[Keymap], assign the macro a key binding such as kbd:[Ctrl + Alt + Shift + I].

Now, you can use the macro key binding and hit kbd:[Enter] to insert a new `itemize` environment with an item. The cursor will automatically move to the first `\item`.

For commands, you can define templates for e.g. `\emph{$PARM1$}`.
