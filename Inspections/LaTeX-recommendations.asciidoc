== Start sentences on a new line

In general we recommend starting every sentence on a new line, especially because this works nicer with version control systems, which work per line.
That also makes it more meaningful to reference a certain line in a document.
It also makes it easier to read when soft wrapping is off.

== Collapse cite commands

`\cite{knuth1990}\cite{goossens1993}` can be replaced with `\cite{knuth1990,goossens1993}`

== [[ins:eqref]] Use `\eqref{...}` instead of `(\ref{...})`
_Since b0.6.6_

Equations should be referenced using `\eqref{...}` rather than `(\ref{...})` to ensure that all your equation references
are formatted in the same way. This inspection is only triggered when the corresponding label was defined in a math environment.
