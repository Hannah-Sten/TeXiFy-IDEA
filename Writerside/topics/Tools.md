# Tools

## Word counting tool

<ui-path>Tools | LaTeX | Word count</ui-path>

Count words in the currently open file, excluding LaTeX commands.
Since 0.7.4, in case the [texcount](https://app.uio.no/ifi/texcount/intro.html) LaTeX package is available, that will be used.
It also counts words in included files.
Otherwise, a built-in word counting tool will be used.
Also includes the text in:

* Sections (\section, \subsection etc.)
* csquotes (\enquote)

## Table Creation Wizard {id="table-creation-wizard"}

<ui-path>Edit | LaTeX | Insert Table...</ui-path>

Displays a dialog with a table creation wizard with a table, caption, and label. Click the plus to add a column, the
minus to remove the column of the currently selected cell, and the pencil to edit this column.
Hit <shortcut>Tab</shortcut> to edit the next cell (same row, column on the right of the current cell).
Hit <shortcut>Tab</shortcut> on the last cell of a column to add a new row.

Each column has a name, and a type.
The available column types are:

* Text: This is normal text, aligned left.
* Math: Use this to display math symbols in your table. All entries in this column will be enclosed in `$..$` when generating
  LaTeX.
* Numbers: As per convention, numbers are aligned on the right.

_Since b0.7.3:_ the table wizard also opens when you paste an HTML table (in your browser, Excel, LibreOffice, ...) into the editor. _Since b0.7.4_ you can also open the wizard in the Generate menu (<shortcut>Alt+Insert</shortcut>).

## Insert Graphic Wizard {id="insert-graphic-wizard"}

_Since b0.7.3_

<ui-path>Edit | LaTeX | Insert Graphic...</ui-path>

Helps you generate LaTeX for inserting graphics. The wizard also opens when dropping a supported image file into a .tex file. You can also paste an image directly from your clipboard into the editor. Youâ€™ll be prompted with the wizard after you have saved the image from your clipboard using another dialog. _Since b0.7.4_ you can also open the wizard in the Generate menu (<shortcut>Alt+Insert</shortcut>).

See [demo video](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17410729/103922867-b0108300-5114-11eb-92d8-25d63eaeb1f1.mp4).

## Insert Dummy Text Wizard {id="insert-dummy-text"}

_Since b0.7.4_

<ui-path>Edit | LaTeX | Insert Dummy Text...</ui-path>

Tool for inserting `blindtext` and `lipsum` commands. Also provides a `raw text` option that just pastes raw dummy text in the editor. There is currently one style available: TeXiFy IDEA Ipsum. This is a report and business style ipsum generator.

You can also access this action via the Generate menu by pressing <shortcut>Alt + Insert</shortcut> in a LaTeX document.

## Clear Auxiliary Files {id="clear-aux-files"}

<ui-path>Tools | LaTeX | Clear Auxiliary Files</ui-path>

Searches the entire project, i.e., every folder in the project module, for auxiliary files and deletes them. The files with the following extensions are defined as auxiliary files:

aux, bbl, bcf, brf, fls, idx, ind, lot, lot, nav, out, snm, toc

If auxiliary files in a certain directory do not get deleted, make sure you mark that directory as a source directory by right-clicking on it and selecting <ui-path>Mark Directory as | Sources Root</ui-path>.

## Clear generated files

_Since b0.6.7_

<ui-path>Tools | LaTeX | Clear Generated Files</ui-path>

Be careful, you might not be able to fully undo this operation!

This will delete all generated files in `src/`, `auxil/` and `out/`, including pdfs and generated `_minted-*` folders.

## Crash reporting dialog

When there is an internal error in TeXiFy, a notification will be shown from which you can directly report the issue to our issue tracker.
