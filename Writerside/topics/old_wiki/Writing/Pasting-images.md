_Since b0.7.3_

You can paste images from your clipboard directly into your LaTeX document. When pasting, you will be prompted by a dialog for saving the image to your workspace. The default folder is "resources", then any source root that is not "src/source(s)", then the source root itself. You can customize the location where the image is going to be saved. You can also specify the file name and the format ("jpg" and "png") are supported. Other formats get converted to "jpg" or "png".

An Insert Graphic dialog will be opened immediately after saving the pasted image.
