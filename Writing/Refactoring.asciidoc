:experimental:
_Since b0.6.9_

Currently, refactoring (renaming) elements is only support for labels.

To use it, place your cursor on a label definition or reference, e.g. `\ref{some-<cursor>label}` and press kbd:[Shift+F6].

To find out what elements need to be renamed as well (definition and other usages), the functionality from link:Find-usages[Find usages] is used.

When you try to rename an element for which refactoring is not supported, a warning "Inserted identifier is not valid" will be shown.
