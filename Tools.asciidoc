== Detexify

_Since b0.7.3_

On the right toolbar, you will find the Detexify tool window. This tool window shows a browser with https://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html[Detexify]:

> Just draw the symbol you are looking for into the square area and look what happens!

This tool window is only available in a project that contains a LaTeX module.

Please note that Detexify is not our tool, see http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html for more information and resources.
