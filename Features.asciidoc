[NOTE]

This is a work in progress. More features should be added, and each should have its own page with documentation.
The idea is to first find a list of all relevant features, group them and then document them.

* Crash reporting dialog

== Inspections

=== BibTeX
* Duplicate ID
* Missing bibliography style
* Duplicate bibliography style commands
* Same bibliography is included multiple times

=== LaTeX

==== Writing style recommendations
* Non-escaped common math operators
* Non-breaking spaces before references
* Ellipsis with `...` instead of `\ldots` or `\dots`
* Normal space after abbreviation
* En dash in number ranges
* End-of-sentence space after sentences ending with capitals
* Use of `.` instead of `\cdot`
* Use of `x` instead of `\times`
* Grouped superscript and subscript
* Insert `\qedhere` in trailing displaymath environment
* Use the matching amssymb symbol for extreme inequalities
* Dotless versions of i and j must be used with diacritics
* Enclose high commands with `\leftX..\rightX`
* Citations must be placed before interpunction
* Gather equations

==== Duplicates
* Command is already defined
* Duplicate labels
* Package has been imported multiple times
* Duplicate command definitions

==== Probable bugs
* Unsupported Unicode character
* Missing documentclass
* Missing document environment
* Missing imports
* Unresolved references
* Non matching environment commands
* Open if-then-else control sequence
* File not found
* Inclusion loops
* Nested includes

==== Redundant LaTeX
* Redundant escape when Unicode is enabled
* Redundant use of `\par`
* Unnecessary whitespace in section commands

==== Conventions
* Missing labels
* Label conventions

==== Discouraged use of TeX or obsolete LaTeX
* Use of `\over` discouraged
* TeX styling primitives usage is discouraged
* Discouraged use of `\def` and `\let`
* link:Inspections#ins:avoid-eqnarray[Avoid `eqnarray`]
* Discouraged use of primitive TeX display math
* Discouraged use of `\makeatletter` in tex sources

==== LaTeX recommendations
* Start sentences on a new line
* Collapse cite commands
* File argument should not include the extension

==== Writing organisation recommendations
* Might break TeXiFy functionality
* Too large sections

== Intentions

=== LaTeX
* Add label defining command to list
* Change equation*/displaymath environment to `\[..\]`
* Change to `\left..\right`
* Convert to other math environment
* Move section contents to separate file
* Move selection contents to separate file
* Split into multiple `\usepackage` commands
