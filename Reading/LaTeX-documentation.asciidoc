You can view LaTeX package documentation using `texdoc`.
First, make sure you have installed `texdoc`, for example on TeX Live with `tlmgr install texdoc`.

Then place your cursor on a LaTeX command and press kbd:[Ctrl + Q].
If the command has a package dependency which is known to TeXiFy, you will get a popup which includes links to the package documentation that is installed locally on your machine.
LaTeX package documentation is written in LaTeX (surprise) so when you click on a link it will open a pdf.

When the command is a `\usepackage` or `\documentclass` then the documentation of the included package or class will be shown.
