== Debugging performance issues

If you do not have a favourite profiler yet, you can use VisualVM. Install it using your package manager or go to https://visualvm.github.io/.

* First, just run TeXiFy like usual.
* Start VisualVM.
* In the Applications panel on the left, identify the instance of IntelliJ where TeXiFy is running, probably it is named Idea. Right-click on it and open.
* Go to the Sampler tab.
* Click Settings, and click Profile only packages. Specify `nl.rubensten.**` or a specific class you want to filter on.
* Click CPU to start profiling, you can take a Snapshot to view and save results. Note that you may have to click a few more levels open to see the actual methods.
