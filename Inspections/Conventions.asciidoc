These inspections are about LaTeX conventions.

== Missing labels
TeXiFy checks for missing labels for sections, chapters and environments. If any of these elements misses a label, a weak warning is displayed together with a quickfix to insert a label.

The inserted label is guaranteed to be unique and follows the label conventions. For sections and chapters the label is inserted after the section, for environments the label is inserted in the environment. If the environment already contains a ```\caption```, the label is inserted after the ```\caption```. Otherwise the label would label the surrounding environment.
