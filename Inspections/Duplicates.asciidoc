== Command is already defined

This inspection will trigger if you use `\newcommand` on a command for which TeXiFy knows that it already exists.
Because TeXiFy does not know about every LaTeX command in every package, it cannot warn you when using `\renewcommand` on a command that does not yet exist.

== Package has been imported multiple times

While importing a package multiple times is not prohibited by LaTeX, in general it is best to avoid duplicate `\usepackage`-like commands.

== Duplicate command definitions

This inspection will check if you have used `\newcommand` multiple times to define the same command.
