When you have no TeX Live or MiKTeX installed directly on your system, but you do have a miktex docker image downloaded (it checks for 'miktex' in the output of `docker image ls`, TeXiFy assumes you want to use Dockerized MiKTeX.
You can also turn it on in settings to always use Dockerized MiKTeX even if you have other LaTeX distributions installed.

Since the official Docker image at https://hub.docker.com/r/miktex/miktex is a bit old, which can cause problems downloading new packages, we provide our own Dockerized MiKTeX via GitHub.
You can pull it with `docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/hannah-sten/texify-idea/miktex:latest`.

You can then run your favourite LaTeX compiler like usual, and TeXify will make sure to perform the `docker run` (you can see the exact command at the top of the output log).
Custom output directories are supported.
