## [[table-creation-wizard]]Table Creation Wizard

menu:Edit[LaTeX > Insert Table...]

Displays a dialog with a table creation wizard with a table, caption, and label. Click the plus to add a column, the
minus to remove the column of the currently selected cell, and the pencil to edit this column.
Hit kbd:[Tab] to edit the next cell (same row, column on the right of the current cell).
Hit kbd:[Tab] on the last cell of a column to add a new row.

Each column has a name, and a type.
The available column types are:

* Text: This is normal text, aligned left.
* Math: Use this to display math symbols in your table. All entries in this column will be enclosed in `$..$` when generating
LaTeX.
* Numbers: As per convention, numbers are aligned on the right.

_Since b0.7.3:_ the table wizard also opens when you paste an HTML table (in your browser, Excel, LibreOffice, ...) into the editor. _Since b0.7.4_ you can also open the wizard in the Generate menu (kbd:[Alt+Insert]).

If auxiliary files in a certain directory do not get deleted, make sure you mark that directory as a source directory by right-clicking on it and selecting menu:Mark Directory as[Sources Root].
