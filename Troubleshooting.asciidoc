==== What to do when TeXiFy-IDEA does not work


== Error running 'main': Cannot run program "pdflatex"

Make sure you have followed all the installation instructions at https://github.com/Ruben-Sten/TeXiFy-IDEA#installation-instructions-installing-intellij-and-the-texify-idea-plugin

. Check if `pdflatex` is properly installed by running in a terminal or command prompt `pdflatex -v`. Probably this is not the case.
. Check if `pdflatex` is installed: if you have MikTeX start the MikTeX console and check that the `pdftex` package is installed. If you have TeX Live, check with `tlmgr install pdftex`.
. If so, make sure you have logged in and out to complete the installation of LaTeX, and especially with TeX Live make sure that TeX Live is added to your PATH.
