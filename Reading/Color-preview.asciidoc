_Since b0.6.10_

A color preview will be shown in the gutter when using an xcolor command like `\color` or `\textcolor`, and when defining a color with xcolor.
This also supports the xcolor syntax to mix colors, like `red!50!yellow`.
When you use the color picker, choosing a different color will not update the LaTeX automatically because we do not know in which representation you want the color.
