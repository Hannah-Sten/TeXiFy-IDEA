== Add label defining command to list

Add a command to the label defining commands list in the settings.

== Toggle inline/display math mode

Switch between inline and display math. A shortcut for an action also present in the link:Intentions#convert-to-other-math-environment[Convert to other math environment] intention.

== Insert comments to disable the formatter

Insert `% @formatter:off` and `% @formatter:on` comments around the environment.
See link:Code-formatting[Code formatting].
Currently only enabled on verbatim-like environments.

== Change to `\left..\right`

Add `\left` and `\right` to brackets, e.g. changing `$(\frac 1 2)$` into `\left(\frac 1 2 \right)`.

== Convert to other math environment

Switch between math environments, e.g. `align*` and inline math.

== [[move-section-to-file]]Move section contents to separate file
Similar to link:Intentions#selection-to-file[move selection contents to separate file], except that it is triggered on
a section heading. Any `\section{...}` command will trigger this. It turns

.main.tex
[source,latex]
----
\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}
    \section{One}
    First section.
\end{document}
----

into the two files

.main.tex
[source,latex]
----
\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}
    \section{One}
    \input{one}
\end{document}
----

.one.tex
[source, latex]
----
First section.
----

== [[selection-to-file]]Move selection contents to separate file
Move the selected text to a new file. When triggering this intention, there will be a popup asking for the name and
location of the new file. Consider the following file:

.main.tex
[source,latex]
----
\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}
    This is a selected sentence.
\end{document}
----

Selecting the text "This is a selected sentence." will enable the intention. After triggering the inspection and naming
your new file `content.tex` we have the following two files

.main.tex
[source, latex]
----
\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}
    \input{content}
\end{document}
----

.content.tex
[source, latex]
----
This is a selected sentence.
----

== Split into multiple `\usepackage` commands

Split `\usepackage{amsmath,amsthm}` into

[source,latex]
----
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsthm}
----
