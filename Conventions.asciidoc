Each project can either use the globally configured conventions (called `Default`) or project specific conventions. You can select the conventions to use with the `Scheme` combobox at the top of the settings page.

[#maximum-section-size]
== Maximum Section Size

When a section grows bigger than the configured number of characters, and there are also other sections in the file, TeXiFy will show a warning and suggest to move the section to separate file.

[#label-conventions]
== Label Conventions

Label conventions allow you to configure which commands and environments should have a label and which prefix the label should habe. TeXiFy will show a warning if any of the configured commands or environments does not have a label and provide a quickfix to add a new label.

In addition, you can configure the preferred prefix for a label, e.g., `fig:` for a figure or `sec:` for a section. TeXiFy will check that all existing labels adhere to the configured convention, and if not, provide a quickfix to change the prefix. Newly added labels will also automatically receive the configured prefix.
