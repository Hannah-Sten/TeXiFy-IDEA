</tldr>

To use TeXiFy, you need at least two things.

* A JetBrains IDE, like IntelliJ, PyCharm, CLion, WebStorm, PhpStorm, GoLand, Rider, etc. You can download IntelliJ from [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download).
* After installing IntelliJ (or any other IDE), if you are at the welcome screen go to <ui-path>Configure | Plugins</ui-path>, or if you have a project open go to <ui-path>File | Settings | Plugins<ui-path> and go to the <control>Marketplace</control> tab. Then, search for TeXiFy, then click Install.
* After installing, click <control>Restart IDE</control>.

While not strictly necessary, the following things are highly recommended.

* Install the PDF Viewer plugin. This is optional, since you can [use any PDF Viewer you want](PDF-viewers.md).
* Install a LaTeX distribution like MiKTeX or TeX Live, following their installation instructions, or the [TeXiFy installation guide](Installation-guide.md).
