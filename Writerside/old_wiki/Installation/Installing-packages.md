How you should install a LaTeX package differs per LaTeX distribution.

Note that the name of your _distributions_ package may be different from the _LaTeX_ package, although often they are the same.
If unsure, check https://ctan.org/pkg/packagename which package you have to install to get your LaTeX package.

## Installing a package when you have the MiKTeX distribution

* Open the MiKTeX console, click Packages and search for the right package to install it. For more information, see https://miktex.org/howto/miktex-console

## Installing a package when you have the TeX Live distribution

* Open a terminal window (in IntelliJ, click Terminal at the bottom) and run `tlmgr install packagename`. tlmgr stands for Tex Live ManaGeR.
