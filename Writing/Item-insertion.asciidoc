When writing in an itemize-like environment, pressing kbd:[Enter] will automatically insert an `\item` on the next line.
This allows for easy writing of lists.

If you are writing an item in the list but you do want a linebreak, for example to start a new sentence, use kbd:[Shift + Enter].

If your cursor is in the middle of a line and you want to split it, but without inserting an `\item` in the middle, use kbd:[Ctrl + Enter].

An example which shows the use of kbd:[Enter], kbd:[Shift + Enter] and kbd:[Ctrl + Enter] (in that order):

Note that for even quicker insertion of an itemize you can use live templates (`itm` for itemize by default) as described in link:Live-templates[Live templates].
