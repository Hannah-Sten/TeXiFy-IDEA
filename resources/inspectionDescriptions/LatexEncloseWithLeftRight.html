Whenever commands are used in math mode that alter the default line height, <tt>\leftX..\rightX</tt> must be used
instead of regular brackets to make sure the brackets have the right height.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
    This inspection checks the following commands:<tt>
    \frac, \dfrac, \sqrt, \sum, \int, \iint, \iiint, \iiiint, \prod, \bigcup, \bigcap, \bigsqcup, \bigsqcap
</tt>
</p>
<p>
    You can also add your own commands in the text area down below.
    Just put every command (with leading <tt>\</tt>) on a seperate line.
